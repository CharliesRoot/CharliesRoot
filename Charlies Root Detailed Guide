 What is your favorite reconnaissance tool? The reason we ask is because you definitely need to find the IP Address of Charlies Root
 
 Now that you know what the Ip address is, perform a scan of that IP Address 
 
 How many Ports are open?
 
 What ports are open?
 
 Out of all the open Ports, which Port can you get the most information from?
 
 See what information you can find from the service that runs on that Port.
 
 There seems to be a lot of hidden information {Flags} embeded in metadata of certain files (Pictures)
 
 It would also be smart to see what Directories you can find and pay attention, certain directories might not be what they are claiming to be 
 
 At this stage, your goal is to find two files. (Crack Password)
 
 i dont need to tell you what to do next.......
 
 Crack Password by implementing the 2 files you found and a tool you think might work. (Clue on Webpage)
 
 Do you have the information you need to get access to the machine? (Username and Password)
 
 Now go back to your scan, notice any other service you can log into based on the information you have?
 
 Get access to the Machine by logging into the service
 
 Cat the file in Documents Folder to get your First FLAG! (its Hidden)
 
 Next Step is to Privilege Escalate to the Root User, i cant help you here but sshhhhh look through some metadata of files that have metadata ;)
 
 What tool does the hidden Flag point you to?
 
 How can you get root access with this particular tool?
 
 Cat the File Root in the Picture Folder to get your last {FLAG} (Its Hidden)
